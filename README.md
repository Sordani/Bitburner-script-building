# Bitburner-script-building
Place to house and save my javascript/netscript script code and share with other for nitpicking and idea sponging.

i am a beginner programmer. I am using the game BitBurner via Steam as a tool to learn, practice, and use coding. I am attempting to use the logic I know and not rely on copypasta code from others, though i have stared at other's code for hours trying to figure out what they wanted to do so i can sponge ideas. i primarily use github as a second harddrive to save all my files.

I am more versed in the workings of bitburner, and having made it to endgame, am making it my mission to write all new code to optimize the game. i'm working on the progression to a continuous batcher and am upgrading how i program. i've discovered objects, maps, function importing and subsequently library scripts, as well as finished a working protobatcher. i've written scripts that do tiny tiny things like output the entire workings of ns.getServer(); to a readable log, as well as created a generic.js script that i test anything i'm workijng on.

i'm including additional scripts like the early-hack-template.js needed to run brain.js effectively, as it passes target parameters over to the early-hack-template loop. this will be made obsolete by any progress made in the controller script that will run the batches of worker scripts that will optimize hacking and removing the effect of said hacks from a prepped server, potentially across all root-accessed servers. this logic is formulating, but the goal is to get to a more optimized state than running early-hack-template.js on n00dles to hack n00dles.
