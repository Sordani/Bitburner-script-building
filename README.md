# Bitburner-script-building
Place to house and save my javascript/netscript script code and share with other for nitpicking and idea sponging.

i am a beginner programmer. I am using the game BitBurner via Steam as a tool to learn, practice, and use coding. I am attempting to use the logic I know and not rely on copypasta code from others, though i have stared at other's code for hours trying to figure out what they wanted to do so i can sponge ideas. i primarily use github as a second harddrive to save all my files.
